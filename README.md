# Real Estate Price Prediction App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will then copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, giving you full control over them.  
All commands except eject will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts.

You don't have to eject unless you want to customize your setup.
